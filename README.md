# Boid simulation

## Separation :
Boids tend to avoid being one over another

## Cohesion :
Boids tend to try to stay together

## Alignement : 
Boids tend to have the same direction as their neighboor

## Colors

Just to make it look like there's different "tribe" : the color chosen by a boid is the medium color of its surroundings, slightly modified by "genetic randomness" at each frame
